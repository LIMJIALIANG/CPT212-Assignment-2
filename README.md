# CPT212-Assignment-2

Assignment instructions/background
The Boyer-Moore algorithm, developed by Robert S. Boyer and J Strother Moore in 1977, is a highly efficient string searching algorithm. It's a benchmark for practical string searching due to the clever approach that leverages information from the pattern itself to skip unnecessary comparisons during the search process.
Tasks:
Briefly explain the concept of string matching and its applications. (CH)
Choose a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, Java, C++) and implement the Boyer-Moore algorithm to search for a pattern within a given text. Analyse the results and discuss the strengths and weaknesses. (DS)(YJ)
Include clear comments within your code to explain each step of the algorithm. (DS)
Select a variation of the Boyer-Moore algorithm (e.g., Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm, which uses a simplified bad character table). (YJ)
Briefly explain the key differences between the original Boyer-Moore and the chosen variation. (YJ)
Briefly explain the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm (another string-matching algorithm). (JL)
Compare and contrast the Boyer-Moore algorithm with the KMP algorithm in terms of their time and space complexity, strengths, and weaknesses. (JL)
Discuss scenarios where one algorithm might be preferable over the other. (CH)
