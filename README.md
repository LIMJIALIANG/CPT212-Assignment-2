# CPT212-Assignment-2

### Assignment instructions/background : 
The Boyer-Moore algorithm, developed by Robert S. Boyer and J Strother Moore in 1977, is a highly efficient string searching algorithm. It's a benchmark for practical string searching due to the clever approach that leverages information from the pattern itself to skip unnecessary comparisons during the search process.

### Tasks:
1. Briefly explain the concept of string matching and its applications.
2. Choose a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, Java, C++) and implement the Boyer-Moore algorithm to search for a pattern within a given text. Analyse the results and discuss the strengths and weaknesses.
3. Include clear comments within your code to explain each step of the algorithm.
4. Select a variation of the Boyer-Moore algorithm (e.g., Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm, which uses a simplified bad character table).
5. Briefly explain the key differences between the original Boyer-Moore and the chosen variation.
6. Briefly explain the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm (another string-matching algorithm).
7. Compare and contrast the Boyer-Moore algorithm with the KMP algorithm in terms of their time and space complexity, strengths, and weaknesses.
8. Discuss scenarios where one algorithm might be preferable over the other.
